Storage Classes

Every C variable has a storage class and a scope. The storage class determines the part of memory where storage is allocated for an object and how long the storage allocation continues to exist. It also determines the scope which specifies the part of the program over which a variable name is visible

Automatic Variables
We have already discussed automatic variables. They are declared at the start of a block. Memory is allocated automatically upon entry to a block and freed automatically upon exit from the block. The scope of automatic variables is local to the block in which they are declared, including any blocks nested within that block.
