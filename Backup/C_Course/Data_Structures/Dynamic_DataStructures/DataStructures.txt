Data
----

	- Distinct pieces of information, usually formatted in a special way. All software is divided into two general 
	  categories: data and programs.
	- Programs are collections of instructions for manipulating data. 
 	- Data can exist in a variety of forms -- as numbers or text as bits and bytes stored in electronic memory.

Data Structures
---------------
	- In programming, the term data structure refers to a scheme for organizing related pieces of information. 
	  The basic types of data structures include: 
	 	1. files 
		2. lists 
		3. arrays 
		4. records etc., 
 	- Each of these basic structures has many variations and allows different operations to be performed on the data.
	- There are many ways to represent a list in a computer.

	There are two types of Data Structures	
	--------------------------------------

	Static vs. Dynamic Data Structures
	----------------------------------
 
	• Static data structures such as arrays allow 
		- fast access to elements 
		- expensive to insert/remove elements 
		- have fixed, maximum size
	• Dynamic data structures such as linked lists allow
		- fast insertion/deletion of element 
		- but slower access to elements 
		- have flexible size


Self Referential Structures
---------------------------

	- A self-referential structure is a data structure that includes references to other data of its same type. 
	- They allow us to implement dynamic data structures in C.
	- Can be linked together to form useful data structures such as lists, queues, stacks and trees
	- Terminated with a NULL pointer (0)

Linked List
***********
	- A list of data items in which each item is linked to the next by  means of a self reference pointer.
