- Data Structure Alignment is the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. 
- It consists of two separate issues: 
	Data Alignment and 
	Data Structure Padding. 
- Aligning data usually refers to allocating memory addresses for data such that each primitive datum is assigned a memory 
  address that is a multiple of its size.
- Data Structure Padding is the insertion of unnamed members in a data structure to preserve the relative alignment of the 
  structure members.
- A memory address a, is said to be n-byte aligned when n is a power of two and a is a multiple of n bytes.

- A char (one byte) will be 1-byte aligned.
- A short (two bytes) will be 2-byte aligned.
- An int (four bytes) will be 4-byte aligned.
- A float (four bytes) will be 4-byte aligned.
- A double (eight bytes) will be 8-byte aligned on Windows and 4-byte aligned on Linux.
