unsigned int a = 5;
signed int b = -1;
>
if(b <= a)
When you compare an unsigned int and a signed int in this
fashion, the signed int is converted to unsigned int. Converting
a negative signed int to a unsigned int is done by adding
UINT_MAX + 1. Thus, the comparison is effectively:
if (UINT_MAX <= 5)
which is false.


For example 
	unsigned int a=18446744073709551615ULL;
        int b=-7;
	if we compare a & b " b is converted into unsigned int by unsigned int max - 6" so
	b==a-6 Returns true
