Formatted Input
---------------
	int  scanf (const char * format, &argument,...);

Read formatted data from stdin.
------------------------------
	Reads data from the standard input (stdin) and stores it into the locations given by               argument(s). Locations pointed by each argument are filled with their corresponding type of        value requested in the format string.
	There must be the same number of type specifiers in format string than arguments passed.

Parameters. 
-----------
	format 
		String that can contain one or more of these items:
 
	Whitespace characters: the function will read and ignore any whitespace characters (this           includes blank, newline and tab characters) encountered before the next non-whitespace             character. This includes any quantity of whitespace characters (including none).
 
	Non-whitespace characters (any character not including blank, newline, tab, or any format          specifier begining with % character): this cause that the function read and discard any            character that match the given non-whitespace character. If this character is not found the        function ends returning error. 

	Format specifiers: A sequence of characters begining with '%' indicates that next data has         to be read and stored at the location pointed by its corresponding argument with a given           format that is specified following this prototype: 
	%[*][width][modifiers]type

	where:
	----- 
	*  		Data is read but ignored. It is not assigned to the corresponding argument.
  	width	  	Specifies the maximum number of characters to be read.
  	modifiers	Specifies a different size for the data pointed by argument:
 			h   : short int
			l   : long int (if integer) or double (if floating point).
			L   : long double 
  	type  		Character specifying the type of data that is expected and how it has to be                        read.
