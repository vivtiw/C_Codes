- A macro is a fragment of code which has been given a name. 
- Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the contents of the macro. 
- There are two kinds of macros. 
	Object-like macros resemble data objects when used, 
	function-like macros resemble function calls.
- They differ mostly in what they look like when they are used.
