"Little Endian" means that the low-order ( LSB ) byte of the number is stored in memory at the lowest address, and the 
high-order byte at the highest address. 

For example, a 4 byte LongInt 
		Byte3 Byte2 Byte1 Byte0

will be arranged in memory as follows: 
	    
		Address+3   Byte3
		Address+2   Byte2
		Address+1   Byte1
		Address+0   Byte0


Big Endian" means that the high-order byte ( MSB ) of the number is stored in memory at the lowest address, and the 
low-order byte at the highest address.  

For example, a 4 byte LongInt 
		Byte3 Byte2 Byte1 Byte0

will be arranged in memory as follows: 

    		Address+0   Byte3
    		Address+1   Byte2
    		Address+2   Byte1
    		Address+3   Byte0
